= Lesson 9: Developing Web Applications (Resources)

== Introduction
Takes https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular[a popular TODO tutorial]
and serves it from Spring Boot.

== Building and running the sample
Use the following commands to build run the application:

```
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/livelessons-web-resources-angular-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

== Understanding the code
Angular and Bootstrap are served from WebJars and the application JavaScript source is
contained in `src/main/resources/static`.

This example also shows how you can call a rest service from Angular. This is fairly
typical in a microservice where the rich web application calls a REST edge service which
ultimately coordinates different microservices. In this example we just call a dummy
endpoint which has been mocked up in the `ToDoController` class.
