= Lesson 4: Working With Data (Spring Data REST)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can expose a Spring Data Repoistory over REST.

== Building and running the sample
Use the following commands to build run the application:

```
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/livelessons-data-rest-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

== Understanding the code
This is exactly the same code as the JPA example, except we have an additional
`spring-boot-starter-data-rest` dependency. The `CarRepository` also includes a couple
of new annotations. The `@RestResource(path="find")` provides a nicer name for the search
URL and `@Param("make")` is used to indicate the name of the query parameter.

Once running you can open a browser to http://localhost:8080/cars to navigate the
elements. To perform a search you can use URLs in the form
http://localhost:8080/cars/search/find?make=honda.
