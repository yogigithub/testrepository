= Lesson 4: Working With Data (MongoDB)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can use the MongoDB document store.

== Building and running the sample
Use the following commands to build run the application:

```
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/livelessons-data-mongodb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

== Understanding the code
The same domain to the JPA sample is used with this demo. Rather than being a `@Entity`
the `Car` here is a `@Document`. It has also been updated with a `position` (the
geo-location where the car is stored).

The `CarRepository` works in the same way as any Spring Data repository and has the
familiar `findByMakeIgnoringCase` method. The demo also includes a `findByPositionNear`
method which shows how you can use MongoDB's geo features.

The `DataMongoDBApplication` show how queries are executed and how you can also use
MongoDB's GridFS to store blob data.
