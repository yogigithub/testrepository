= Lesson 4: Working With Data (Relational Database with JDBC)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can access a classic relational database using Spring JDBC.

== Building and running the sample
Use the following commands to build run the application:

```
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/livelessons-data-jdbc-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

== Understanding the code
This demo provides the same domain as the JPA sample but this time the `Car` class is
a POJO and isn't managed by JPA. The `CarRepository` implements the access logic and
maps returned rows to the actual object.

This sample also uses `src/main/resources/schema.sql` and `src/main/resources/data.sql`
scripts (picked up by convention) to create and populate the database.

If you want to try the application with a real MySQL server rather than an in-memory
database you can uncomment the entries in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
