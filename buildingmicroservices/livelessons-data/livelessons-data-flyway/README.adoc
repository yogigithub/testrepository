= Lesson 4: Working With Data (Flyway Migration)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can use flyway to upgrade a live database.

== Building and running the sample
Use the following commands to build run the application:

```
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/livelessons-flyway-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

== Understanding the code
Building on the earlier JPA example this demo shows how a new `color` column could be
added to the database. The additional `flyway` dependency in the `pom.xml` along with
scripts in `src/main/db/migration` is all that's needed.

Two scripts are provided. The first creates the initial structure and the second upgrades
it. Flyway adds an additional meta-table that tracks when an update has been applied and
prevents it from running multiple times.
