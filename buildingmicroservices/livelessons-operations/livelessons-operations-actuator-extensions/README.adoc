= Lesson 3: Creating Operations-Friendly Microservices (Extending Actuator)

== Introduction
Demonstrates how you can add your own actuator endpoints.

== Building and running the sample
Use the following commands to build run the application:

```
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/livelessons-operations-actuator-extensions-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

== Understanding the code
The `WeatherEndpoint` shows how you can easily add actuator endpoints by writing a bean
that implements the `Endpoint` interface (in this case by extending `AbstractEndpoint`).
You can access in the same way as the standard ones (HTTP, SSH, JMX).

The `WeatherMvcEndpoint` shows how you can also write specific extensions to be used
when the endpoint is accessed over HTTP. In this case we are adding a content type
support. If you open http://localhost:8080/weather in a browser you will see red text,
if you use `curl` you don't see any HTML markup.
