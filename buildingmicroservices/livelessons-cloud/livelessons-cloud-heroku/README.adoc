= Lesson 3: Reaching For The Clouds (Heroku)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can push a Spring Boot application to Heroku. You
will need a https://heroku.com/[Heroku account] and the
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java#set-up[`heroku` command
line toolbelt] installed. This sample uses the `heroku-maven-plugin` to directly push
the build application jar.

== Prerequisites
Ensure that you have logged into Heroku and created an application:

```
$ heroku login
$ heroku create -n
```

You will need the name of the created application later.

== Pushing to Heroku
To build an push the application use the following command:

```
$ mvn clean package heroku:deploy -Dheroku.appName=<appname>
```

NOTE: The upload to Heroku can take some time to complete.
